# Snake Game using Turtle#

This is a snake game which is built using Turle and python commands.

##What the project does?##
This project is designed for snake game lovers where you guide your snake to the food and survive as long as you can.
Each time when the snake eats food, it will increase the score with +1.

Beware of walls!
If you accedently hit the wall, your snake will die and sadly game over.
The challenge is to hit the high score before you hit the wall. 😜
